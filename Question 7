Business Scenario
Some customers may have been onboarded but have never used their card. These inactive customers represent potential revenue if the bank can activate them through campaigns or incentives.

Your Task
Using the customer, card, and transaction tables:

Identify customers who have never performed a single transaction on any of their cards
Return the list of such customer IDs. These are customers in Customer_base with zero matching transactions in Transaction_base.



SELECT
  cust.cust_id
FROM
  customer_base cust
  LEFT JOIN card_base c ON cust.cust_id = c.cust_id
  LEFT JOIN transaction_base t ON c.card_number = t.credit_card_id
WHERE
  t.transaction_id IS NULL;
