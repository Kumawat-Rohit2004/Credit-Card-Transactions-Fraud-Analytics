Business Scenario
Fraud analysts want to know in which month the bank saw the most fraud activity. This can help them correlate issues with campaigns, system releases, or external events.

Your Task
Using the fraud and transaction tables:

Consider only transactions flagged as fraud
Group them by calendar month
Find the month that has the highest count of fraudulent transactions
Return the fraud month (e.g. 2023-05-01 as month start) and the fraud count.


select
  DATE_TRUNC('month', t.transaction_date)::date as fraud_month,
  count(f.FRAUD_FLAG) as fraud_txn_count
from
  fraud_base f
  join transaction_base t on f.TRANSACTION_ID = t.TRANSACTION_ID
group by
  fraud_month
order by
  fraud_txn_count desc
limit
