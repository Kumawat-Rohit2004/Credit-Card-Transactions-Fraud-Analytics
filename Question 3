Business Scenario
Risk management wants to understand whether fraud is more common among low-limit or high-limit customers. A starting point is to analyze the range of credit limits among customers who have had at least one fraudulent transaction.

Your Task
Using the fraud, transaction, and card tables:

Identify all cards that have at least one fraudulent transaction
From those cards, find the minimum and maximum credit limit
Return the overall min_credit_limit and max_credit_limit among cards involved in fraud.


with
  fraud as (
    select
      f.TRANSACTION_ID as t_id,
      t.CREDIT_CARD_ID as card_id
    from
      fraud_base f
      inner join transaction_base t on f.TRANSACTION_ID = t.TRANSACTION_ID
    where
      f.FRAUD_FLAG = 1
  )
select
  min(c.CREDIT_LIMIT) as MIN_LIMIT,
  max(c.CREDIT_LIMIT) as MAX_LIMIT
from
  fraud f
  join card_base c on f.card_id = c.CARD_NUMBER
